Here’s a comprehensive summary of all the functionalities handled by the **Streamlit Badminton Player Rotation App** that we developed together:

---

### 🏸 **Core Functionalities**

1. **Player Input Options**:
   - Upload player names via **CSV or Excel** (expects a `Name` column).
   - Manually enter player names as a **comma-separated list**.

2. **Player Selection**:
   - Select **players present today** from the uploaded or entered list.
   - Dynamically update this list as players are added or removed.

3. **Court Configuration**:
   - Input the **number of available courts** (minimum 1).
   - Courts can host either **doubles (4 players)** or **singles (2 players)** matches.

### 🔁 **Rotation Logic**

4. **Minimum Requirements**:
   - Requires at least **3 active players** to begin rotation.
   - Smart allocation of players to courts based on availability.

5. **Smart Match Allocation**:
   - Prioritizes **doubles matches** when enough players are available.
   - Falls back to **singles matches** when fewer players are available.
   - Ensures **no court is left underutilized** if players are sufficient.

6. **Bench Management**:
   - Excess players are **benched** and rotated in future matches.
   - Bench queue is maintained and updated after each rotation.

### 🛋️ **Rest/Break Handling**

7. **Voluntary Rest Area**:
   - Players can be moved to a **rest/break list**.
   - These players are **excluded from court allocation**.
   - Once removed from rest, they are **automatically re-included** in the active pool.

8. **Dynamic Active Player Calculation**:
   - Before each rotation, the app **recalculates active players** by excluding those resting.
   - Prevents resting players from being accidentally assigned to courts.

### 🧾 **Rotation History Tracking**

9. **Detailed Match History**:
   - Each rotation logs:
     - Court-to-player allocations
     - Benched players
     - Resting players
   - Displayed in a **chronological history section**.

10. **Reset Functionality**:
    - A reset button clears:
      - Rotation count
      - Bench queue
      - Resting players
      - Rotation history
